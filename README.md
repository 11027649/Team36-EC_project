# Team36-EC_project
Designing and implementing an EA to maximise three continuous optimisation problems (Bent Cigar, Katsuura, and Schaffers F7 function) in 10 dimensions with a limited computational budget.


### Schedule
#### Monday 10-9-18
Set up Github and initialised Java Code.

Section
Initialised the population (randomly)
Ideas about how to implement "Survival of the Fittest"

#### Tuesday 11-9-18
Emma made sure the initialized population was also remembered.

#### Wednesday 12-9-18
Natasja tried to implement a graphing function. Couldn't import the BarChart class so don't know if it works. Seemed fun and
nice for later to be able to see the fitness of the population/ the individuals in the population.
This is how it's supposed to work: http://blue-walrus.com/2014/03/bar-chart-in-java-swing/
